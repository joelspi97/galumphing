This is a fullstack freelance project made for a client, whom allowed me to share publicly the source code of his website.

It features:
* A Node.js backend that allows the owner to authenticate and upload new images on the website.
* A fully responsive UI that gets data from the backend and displays it.
* A contact form that allows users to send emails to the website owner, by making use of the Node.js server.
* An accessible UI that follows the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 (AAA).

To build it I used the following:
* Angular 14
* Node.js
* Sass
